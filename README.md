# Machine Learning capstone project
## Loan case paid off or not:
        Predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. The Prediction use different Machine Learning algorithms in IBM Watson studio First historical dataset from previous loan applications. Then clean the data and apply different classification algorithm.

Import the loan case CSV file using the link: https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/loan_train.csv.

Perform the Data visualization and pre-processing. Convert Categorical features to numerical values. Use one hot encoding technique to conver categorical varables to binary variables and append them to the feature Data Frame.
        
Following algorithms to build the models:
        •	k-Nearest Neighbour
        •	Decision Tree
        •	Support Vector Machine
        •	Logistic Regression
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier using the metrics when these are applicable:
        • Jaccard index
        • F1-score
        • LogLoass
