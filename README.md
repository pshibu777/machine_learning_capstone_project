# Machine Learning capstone project
## Loan case paid off or not:
        Predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. The Prediction use different Machine Learning algorithms in IBM Watson studio First historical dataset from previous loan applications. Then clean the data and apply different classification algorithm.
Following algorithms to build the models:
        •	k-Nearest Neighbour
        •	Decision Tree
        •	Support Vector Machine
        •	Logistic Regression
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier using the metrics when these are applicable:
        • Jaccard index
        • F1-score
        • LogLoass
